							<h1>About Us</h1>
					
							<div class="inner">
								<p>Thanks for reaching out. The Avenues Recovery website is still under construction and will be rolled out very soon.
								Avenues Recovery is formerly known as Resurrection Recovery. We have been in business since 2015 and last year, I bought
								out my partner and changed the name and focus of service delivery.
								We are an intensive outpatient, co-occurring disorders clinic, licensed by DHS and have both mental health practitioners
								and substance use disorder personnel on staff. We follow the ASAM criteria and provide 2.1 and 2.5 levels of care. The
								2.1 program consists of 8 hours a week of group and 1 individual session and does not include housing. The level 2.5 is
								IOP plus lodging. We have a women’s house that lodges 4 women (single room occupancy) and our men’s house is a duplex
								with 4 men on each level. That program requires clients to attend treatment 20 hours a week, Monday through Friday, from
								9:00 am to 1:00 pm. We have a Peer Recovery Specialist, who monitors the 2.5 level of care participants and provides
								some case management services, such as getting people to and from appointments and taking them to food shelves or other
								community-based services.
								The length of stay for the 2.5 level of care is needs-based and generally lasts about 18 weeks. We do not require a
								housing deposit and clients can keep any money they earn. Clients are encouraged to seek employment if that is what they
								desire as long as it does not interfere with treatment service hours. People who are receiving Social Security or
								General Assistance are also allowed to keep their money. We allow clients to keep their income so they can learn money
								management skills and be able to save for independent living following treatment. Our team works diligently to help our
								clients obtain or return to safe, supportive living environments. We offer step-down from 2.5 to 2.1 as well, to keep
								people engaged in the entire process. We are also a great opportunity for people stepping down from an inpatient setting
								who may not have stable housing to return to.
								Currently, we have one opening in the men’s house and one in the women’s house, but those numbers change regularly. Our
								women’s house is on Como Avenue in St. Paul, near the lake and our men’s house is located off Payne Avenue, near Tedesco
								on the east side of St. Paul. Avenues Recovery is located on Suburban Avenue, off I-94 near the White Bear Avenue exit.
								Currently, we are in network with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, UCare, Hennepin Health and CCDTF/Direct Access
								funding sources. We provide Rule 25 and Comprehensive Substance Use Assessments, available by appointment or walk-ins
								are welcome Monday-Friday 9:00 am to 2:00 pm. Our MH staff are available for MH Diagnostic Assessment by appointment and
								same-day services are often open. Follow us on fast-tracker for daily updates.
								For any further questions, please contact our intake coordinator, Sahra Mohamed at 651-702-2700 for more information.
